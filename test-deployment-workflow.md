# Test Deployment Workflow Enhancement

This file tests the enhanced GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

## Expected Behavior

### For this branch (copilot/fix-19):
1. ✅ Should trigger on push (existing behavior)
2. ✅ Should build successfully
3. ✅ Should deploy to `https://litlfred.github.io/pqtorus/copilot/fix-19/`

### For pull requests:
1. ✅ Should trigger on PR creation
2. ✅ Should add/update PR comment with preview link
3. ✅ Should build and deploy to branch-specific subdirectory

### For manual dispatch:
1. ✅ Should allow branch selection in GitHub Actions UI
2. ✅ Should deploy the selected branch
3. ✅ Should be accessible from Actions tab

## Features Added

- **Pull Request Integration**: Automatic PR comments with clickable deployment links
- **Manual Deployment**: Workflow dispatch for any branch via GitHub Actions UI
- **Enhanced Environment**: Proper GitHub Pages environment configuration
- **Smart Commenting**: Updates existing comments instead of creating duplicates

## Test Results

This file serves as a test trigger. The workflow should:
1. Build the React application in `web/`
2. Deploy to `gh-pages` branch under `copilot/fix-19/` subdirectory
3. Make the preview available at the expected URL
