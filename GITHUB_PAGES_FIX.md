# GitHub Pages Deployment Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary

The GitHub Actions workflow for automated branch previews is showing "action_required" status instead of successfully deploying to GitHub Pages. The error mentioned in issue #21 was:

```
remote: Permission to litlfred/pqtorus.git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/litlfred/pqtorus.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

## Investigation Results

### ✅ What's Working
- The build process works correctly (`npm run build` succeeds)
- The workflow configuration is correct
- The gh-pages branch exists and has the expected structure:
  - `.nojekyll` file
  - `main/` directory with built React application
  - Proper branch preview structure

### ❌ What's Not Working
- Workflow runs complete with "action_required" status
- No actual deployment jobs execute
- New branch previews are not being created

## Root Cause

The "action_required" conclusion indicates a **repository-level configuration issue**, not a workflow problem. This typically means GitHub Pages is not properly configured to accept deployments from GitHub Actions.

## Required Fix (Repository Owner Only)

You need to update your repository settings. Here's how:

### 1. Configure GitHub Pages Source

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/litlfred/pqtorus
2. Click **Settings** (top navigation)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
5. Save the changes

### 2. Update Actions Permissions

1. In repository **Settings**, go to **Actions** → **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select:
   - ✅ **"Read and write permissions"**
   - ✅ **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
3. Save the changes

### 3. Check Environment Protection (if exists)

1. In repository **Settings**, go to **Environments**
2. If you see a **"github-pages"** environment, click on it
3. Remove any **"Required reviewers"** or approval requirements
4. Save if changes were made

## Testing the Fix

After making these changes:

1. Push a new commit to any branch (except gh-pages)
2. The workflow should now execute successfully
3. Check that a new directory appears in the gh-pages branch
4. Verify the preview URL works: `https://litlfred.github.io/pqtorus/[branch-name]/`

## Current Branch Preview URLs

Based on the existing gh-pages structure:
- Main branch: https://litlfred.github.io/pqtorus/main/

## Why This Happened

GitHub changed their GitHub Pages deployment model to be more secure. The new system requires explicit configuration to allow GitHub Actions to deploy to Pages, rather than allowing direct pushes to the gh-pages branch.

## Alternative Solution

If the above doesn't work, you can also:

1. Create a Personal Access Token with `Contents: write` permission
2. Add it as a repository secret named `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. Update the workflow to use this token

But the repository settings approach is recommended and more secure.
